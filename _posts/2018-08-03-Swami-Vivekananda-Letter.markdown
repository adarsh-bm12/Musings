I am persuaded that a leader is not made in one life. He has to be born for it. For the difficulty is not in organisation and making plans; the test, the real test of the leader, lies in holding widely different people together along the line of their common sympathies. And this can only be done unconsciously, never by trying.

I was asked by an English friend on the eve of my departure: “**Swami, how do you like now your motherland after four years’ experience of the luxurious, glorious, powerful West?**” I could only answer: *“**India I loved before I came away. Now the very dust of India has become holy to me, the very air is now to me holy; it is now the holy land, the place of pilgrimage, the Tirtha***".

***We must electrify society, electrify the world.***... **Let character be formed and then I shall be in your midst. ... A huge spiritual tidal wave is coming – he, who is low, shall become noble, and he, who is ignorant, shall become the teacher of great scholars - through His grace. “Uttisthata jagrata prapya varan nibodhata - Arise! Awake! and stop not till the goal is reached**”. ...

Arise! Arise! A tidal wave is coming! Onward! Men and women, down to the Chandala - all are pure in His eyes. Onward! Onward! There is no time to care for name, or fame, or Mukti, or Bhakti! We shall look to these some other time. Now in this life let us infinitely spread his lofty character, his sublime life, his infinite soul. This is the only work - there is nothing else to do. Wherever his name will reach, the veriest worm will attain divinity, nay, is actually attaining it; you have got eyes, and don’t you see it? Is it a child’s play? Is it silly prattle? Is it foolery? “  *Uttisthata jagrata - Arise! Awake!” Great Lord! He is at our back. I cannot write any more - onward! I only tell you this, that whoever reads this letter will imbibe my spirit*! Have faith! Onward! Great Lord! I feel as if somebody is moving my hand to write in this way. Onward! Great Lord! Everyone will be swept away! Take care, he is coming! Whoever will be ready to serve Him - no, not Him, but His children: the poor and the downtrodden, the sinful and the afflicted, down to the very worm - who will be ready to serve these, in them He will manifest Himself. Through their tongue the Goddess of Learning Herself will speak, and the Divine Mother – the Embodiment of all Power - will enthrone Herself in their hearts.

***We shall crush the stars to atoms, and unhinge the Universe. Don’t you know who we are? We are the servants of Sri Ramakrishna.***

My children must plunge into the breach, must renounce the world - then the firm foundation will be laid. ...

***Work unto death - I am with you, and when I am gone, my spirit will work with you. This life comes and goes - wealth, fame, enjoyments are only of a few days. It is better, far better to die on the field of duty, preaching the Truth, than to die like a worldly worm. Advance!***
